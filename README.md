 it is aprogram where two users can play Pig dice against each other using JavaScript programming skills such as constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, methods, jQuery and DOM manipulation and traversal.

# Game Workflow

* Each player gets a turn to roll the dice
* Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold"
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The first player to score 100 or more points wins
